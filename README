Learnthings.js

An attempt to create a Javascript port of https://github.com/ykarikos/learnthings

Try it at http://ranskan.peruna.fi/learnthings.js/

Tested on Chrome and Firefox.

Shortcomings:
 - Staying in full screen mode can not be guaranteed as in the Python version
   without some kiosk plugins that are always somehow limited and hacky
 - Coded on bare jQuery, but the problem space would be better solved
   with some JS game library.
